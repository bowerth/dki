byline: Building a library of functions callable from Excel, a web application, command line and analytical tools (R, SAS, Eviews, etc.)

## Concept

### Shared Code Base

Develop routines in a language that can be called from statistical tools, avoiding the need to re-implement any algorithm in the tool's specific syntax:

- C/C++: compiled language for fast loop operations
- Java: compiled language with large choice of domain-specific libraries available, can be sourced from most tools including web applications or running in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Scala: recent language inspired by Java; designed for software platforms requiring parallel or concurrent computations
- Python: scripting language with large ecosystem for efficient scietific computation; Python functions can be used in LibreOffice Calc, an open source variant of MS Excel or using system commands
- R: developed by statisticians, geared towards statistics; recently adopted by Microsoft with [Microsoft R Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/r-server) and Microsoft R Open [MRO](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/open); enhanced packaging features making it easy to develop software for use by community members

### Approach

- create functions for use in statistical tools based on actual usage information obtained from the technical review
- interaction with other directorates of the Organisation, e.g. the Statistics Directorate
- establish links to exisiting projects, e.g. "program code management" and "developer user collaboration"
- establish gouvernance and policies for submission and review of algorithms
- proposition to open the developed algorithm library to non-contributing users (covering aspects such as license, server, PAC, etc.)
